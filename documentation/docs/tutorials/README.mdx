# Tutorials

A [tutorials](https://diataxis.fr/tutorials/) is the most complex type of documentation you will have. These usually
require work to be maintained, touch a variety of subjects and should guide the user in much more details than a
[how-tos](../examples/README.md) or [explanations](../key_concepts/README.md).

For more information on tutorials, please visit the [IOTA Wiki Tutorial template](https://github.com/iota-wiki/tutorial-template).
